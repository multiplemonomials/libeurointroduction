This is a collection of c++ libraries that Randall and I have written.

It includes:

EzLogger -- guaranteed to be easier to set up then that incomprehensible boost::log
FunctionTimer -- one macro that measures how long it takes to run a function
ThreadSafeQueue -- a vital primitive for communication between threads
